# How to play

**Note:** This article is about how to download and join the game. If you are looking for instructions on how to play once inside the game, check [the starter guide instead](starter_guide.md).

## Downloading

There are two options to play online: Either use SS14's launcher and hub (requires an account), or use Civ13's dedicated client (only available for Windows for now).

### Civ13 Client

1. Download the Civ13 client [here](https://github.com/Civ13/civ14-launcher/releases/).
2. Run it and let it update the game files.
3. Input the server's address (civ13.com for the official one) and press join.

### SS14 Launcher

1. Download the SS14 launcher [here](https://spacestation14.com/about/download/).
2. Create an account for the SS14 hub, if you do not have one already.
3. Look for Civilization 14 on the Hub, or use the Direct Connect option and use ss14://civ13.com for the official server.
4. Join and wait for the launcher to update the game's files.

## Playtesting / Hosting Locally

If you want to play it locally to test/etc, you will need to download the source code and follow the instructions on the [github](https://github.com/Civ13/Civ14).
