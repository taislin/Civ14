If you’re new to roleplaying or are unfamiliar with IC and OOC please read on. If not, skip to the next section.

SS14 is at its core a roleplaying game - You play a role on the station through your character which you can customise from the lobby prior to joining the game. You can select the roles or jobs your character plays via the customisation menu too. When you’re in a round playing your character, you are IC or In Character. When you’re in character you forget any knowledge of previous rounds or essentially of the outside world and you play as if you’re a member of the station's crew.

Therefore, OOC or Out of Character is any conversations you have outside of the game world e.g. in the OOC chat, on discord or with your friends. You shouldn’t discuss the current round or anything that’s IC (in character) in out of character OOC chats. Likewise anything you see or read in OOC cannot be used by your character in game such as if someone on discord names a traitor or tells you they’re dying in a certain location and for you to go help them. This is known as metagaming and will get you banned if discovered.

If you suspect a player in game is metagaming, then report them via ahelp or discord.

To summarise, when you’re in game, don’t discuss the round anywhere else until the round is over and don’t share information about the round in OOC such as if you’re dying, where you are or if you find a traitor.
